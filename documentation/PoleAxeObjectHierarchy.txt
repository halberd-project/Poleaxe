Poleaxe Object Hierarchy

	This is a rought draft of a class hierarchy for the Poleaxe graphical user interface sdk for Halberd.  This class system is similiar in concept to the Microsoft
Foundation Classes in that the class are all related to each other and can contain certain and interface with the other classes.  The system I have designed will change 
drastically from now until the sdk is complete and finished.  The 'Object' base class is derived into other child classes which are used by the programmer and operating
system.  

	The first of which is the Frame class, which will have dialog boxes, windows, toolbars, menubars and other such objects derived from it.  The trait that all of these
classes share is their ability to hold and contain other objects, frames, or controls.

	The second are controls.  These differ from the Frame classes in that these do not inherintly contain other classes, they are essentially child classes that interact 
with the user, such as buttons, scroll bars, text boxes, etc.

	The last I have for now, and I am sure to come up with a few other top level classes to join these existing three, are the Graphics classes.  These interface with
the Allegro graphics API.  These are Bitmaps, Surfaces, Colors, Pens, Brushes and other classes and functions that allow the user or programmer to draw elements to surfaces,
files, or the screen.

	After these I may add other classes for things such as networking, timers and other high level functions and concepts that we can encapsulate in out API.
